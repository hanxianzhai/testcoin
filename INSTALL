DEVCOIN INSTALL
===============


In this directory are some files that you need to have in
the "currenct directory" when you run devcoind, devcoin,
or devcoin-qt

The files that must be in the current directory at runtime
are the receiver_*.csv files.

This program uses boost and curl, you will need the
development header files of both to compile it and the
rutime libraries of both to run it.

It also uses Berkeley DB database, you are always free
to upgrade to newest version but cannot downgrade existing
databases such as wallets back to an older version.


----------
COMPILING:
----------

You need to be in the subdirectory named src to do
the compile.

To make without UPNP:

make -f makefile.whatever USE_UPNP= bitcoind


To make without UPNP activated:

make -f makefile.whatever USE_UPNP=1 bitcoind


Once it has made bitcoind one usually strips it to save disk
space and renames it to devcoind
